# Interactive Pipe Flow Simulation: Report & Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This report documents an interactive pipe flow simulation developed for visualizing and analyzing fluid behavior in pipes with varying cross-sectional areas. The simulation demonstrates fundamental fluid dynamics principles, particularly focusing on the continuity equation and Bernoulli's principle.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1. Continuity Equation

In fluid dynamics, the continuity equation expresses the conservation of mass in a flowing fluid. For an incompressible fluid in a pipe with no branches, the product of cross-sectional area and velocity must remain constant along the pipe:

$A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2$

Where:
- $A_1$, $A_2$ are cross-sectional areas at points 1 and 2
- $v_1$, $v_2$ are fluid velocities at points 1 and 2

This means that when a pipe narrows, the fluid velocity must increase to maintain the same mass flow rate, and conversely, when a pipe widens, the fluid velocity decreases.

### 2.2. Bernoulli's Principle

Bernoulli's principle relates pressure, velocity, and elevation in a moving fluid. For a horizontal pipe with constant elevation, the principle can be simplified to:

$P_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2$

Where:
- $P_1$, $P_2$ are pressures at points 1 and 2
- $\rho$ is the fluid density
- $v_1$, $v_2$ are fluid velocities at points 1 and 2

This equation shows that in regions of high velocity, pressure decreases, and vice versa. This principle explains why pressure drops in narrowed sections of pipe where velocity increases.

## 5. Example Simulation Setup

The default configuration demonstrates several key fluid dynamics concepts:

1. **Pipe Configuration**
   - Initial section: length 2m, diameter 0.3m
   - Constriction: length 1m, diameter 0.15m
   - Recovery section: length 2m, diameter 0.3m

   - Final section: length 2m, diameter 0.3m

2. **Observable Phenomena**
   - Increased velocity in constricted sections
   - Decreased pressure in high-velocity regions
   - Recovery of pressure in expanded sections
   - Conservation of mass throughout the system

## 6. Mathematical Implementation

### 6.1. Velocity Calculation
```python
def calculate_velocities(self):
    if not self.sections:
        return
        
    initial_area = self.sections[0]['area']
    initial_velocity = self.initial_velocity
    
    for section in self.sections:
        section['velocity'] = initial_velocity * (initial_area / section['area'])
```

This implementation directly applies the continuity equation, calculating each section's velocity based on the initial flow rate and the ratio of areas.

### 6.2. Pressure Calculation
```python
def calculate_pressures(self):
    if not self.sections:
        return
        
    self.calculate_velocities()
    
    initial_pressure = self.p0
    initial_velocity = self.sections[0]['velocity']
    
    for section in self.sections:
        dynamic_pressure = 0.5 * self.density * (initial_velocity**2 - section['velocity']**2)
        section['pressure'] = initial_pressure + dynamic_pressure
```

This method implements Bernoulli's equation to determine pressure changes based on velocity differences, accounting for the dynamic pressure term.
